    <h3>The Best Homemade Lasagna</h3>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>Â½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
