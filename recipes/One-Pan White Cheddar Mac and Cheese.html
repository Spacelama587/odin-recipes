    <p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
        </li>
        <li>
            2 ½ cups milk
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups water
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon snipped chives
        </li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
    </li>
    <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
    <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
